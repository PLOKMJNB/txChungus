Getting Steam errors like: *"Unable to find 'steam' identifier"* or *"steam ID not enabled"* but steam is running?
Try these following suggestions:
:one: Set your [Steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
:two: Add FiveM to your steam library
> Open your Steam launcher and go to your library
> Click the **`+ ADD A GAME`** located in bottom left corner of steam
> Click add non-steam game
> And choose FiveM from the pop-up list (*C:\Users\\<user>\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.exe* if not found on the list)
